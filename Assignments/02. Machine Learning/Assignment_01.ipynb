    "**1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning is a technique of **helping the machine learn how to take decisions logically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal defination by **Tom Mitcell** is: A computer program is said to learn form the **experience *E*** with respect to the to some **task *T*** and some **performance measure *P***, if its performance on ***T*** is improved, as measured by ***P*** with the experience ***E***. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Machine learning is great for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problems for which existing solutions require lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules. (A machine learning model can often simplify code and perform better than traditional approch) Ex. SPAM filters\n",
    "2. Complex problems for which using traditional approach yields no good solution. Such as speech recognizagtion, natural language processing etc.\n",
    "3. Fluctuating enviroments. (A machine learning system can easily be ratained on new data, always keeping it up to date.)\n",
    "4. Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data to discover hidden patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A labeled training set is a training set that **contains the desired solution (a.k.a. a label)** for each instance. The labeled training set is used to train a supervised learning algorithm to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the algorithm analyzes the labeled data to identify patterns and relationships between the input features and the corresponding output labels. The algorithm then adjusts its parameters or weights to improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Once the training process is complete, the algorithm can be used to predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs. The accuracy of the algorithm's predictions will depend on the quality and quantity of the labeled training data, as well as the complexity and suitability of the algorithm for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are the two most important task that are supervised?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The two most important task that are supervised are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Classification**: ex. Spam email filter\n",
    "2. **Regression**: ex. predict a target numerical value (car price, house price etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Can you think of four examples of unsupervised task?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Below are the four examples of unsupervised task\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Here the goal is to simplyfy the data without loosing too much information.\n",
    "2. **Anomaly Detection**: Detecting unusual credit card transctions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects, or automatically removing outliers from the dataset etc.\n",
    "3. **Novelty Detection**: It aims to detect new instances that look different from all the instances in the training set. \n",
    "4. **Association Rule Learning**: Here the goal is to dig into large amount of data and discover interesting relations between attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. State the machine learning model that would best to make a robot walk through various unfamillar terrains.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The machine learning model that is best suited to make a robot walk through various unfamillar terrains is **Reinforcement Learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Which algorithm you will use to divide the your customer into different groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** To divide the customers into different group, a **clustering algorithm** is best suited to detect the groups of similar customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be supervised or unsupervised learning problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Spam detection is an example of the **supervised learning problem**.It is trained with many example emils with there class (spam or ham) and it must learn how to classify (Classification) the new emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What is concept of online learning system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In **Online Learning**, we train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called mini-batches. Each leaning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives. Online learning is useful for systems that need to adapt to change extermly rapidly ex. detecting new patterns in the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differs from the core learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** **Out-of-core** learning is a technique used in machine learning to handle very large datasets that do not fit into memory. The algorithm loads part of the data in the form of mini-batches, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has  run on all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-core learning differs from in-core learning, also known as batch learning, where the entire dataset is loaded into memory at once, and the model is trained on the entire dataset. In-core learning requires a machine with enough memory to hold the entire dataset, which can be a challenge for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What kind of learning algorithm makes prediction using a similiarity measure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In the **Instance-based learning** algorithm, the system learns the examples by heart and then generalizes to new cases by using a **similiarity measure** to compare them to the learned examples or a subset of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will predict given a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm tries to find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well to new instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm itself, not of the model (e.g., the amount of regularization to apply)\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Model-based learning algorithms search for an **optimal value** for the model parameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. We usually train such systems by minimizing a **cost function** that measures how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new instance's features into the model's prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Main challenges of Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training data is too small, nonrepresentative (sampling bias) or of poor quality (too noisy, full of errors, outliers)\n",
    "2. Irrelevant Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overfitting the training data\n",
    "4. Underfitting the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. What happens of the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you thing of three different options?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** When model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the new situations, it is called **overfitting on the training data**. Below are possible solution:\n",
    "1. Simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters (e.g. a linear model rather than a high-degree polunonminal model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data, or by constraining the model.\n",
    "2. Gather more traing data.\n",
    "3. Reduce the noise in the training data (e.g. fix data errors and remove outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**16. What exatly is a test set, and why would you need one?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** It is a better option to split the data into two sets train and test. We train the model using train data and test it using test data set. A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on new instances, before the model is launched in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. What is validation set's purpose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best model and tune the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**18 What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the training data and the data used in the validation and test datasets (which should always be as close as possible to the data used once the model is in production). The train-dev set is a part of the training set that's held out (the model is not trained on it). The model is trained on the rest of the training set, and evaluated on both the train-dev set and the validation set. If the model performs well on the training set but not on the train-dev set, then the model is likely overfitting the training set. If it performs well on both the training set and the train-dev set, but not on the validation set, then there is probably a significant data mismatch between the training data and the validation + test data, and you should try to improve the training data to make it look more like the validation + test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**19. What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** If you tune hyperparameters using the test set, you risk overfitting the test set, and the generalization error you measure will be optimistic (you may launch a model that performs worse than you expect)."
