    "**2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** An iterator is any python object which can be iterated upon and returns data one at a time. To create an iterator we have to implement an **Iterator Protocol**, a class with `iter()` and `next()` methods. We also need to keep track of the internal states and handle the `StopIteration` exception so that the code is not broken. While this can be done manually there is a much better way to do it. Use a Generator. We did not need to worry about the iterator protocol if we used a generator. So we can safely say that Generator is a function which return an iterator."

    "**4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The yield statement temporarily halts a function while retaining its local values and later continues from there on successive calls. The yield statement is what makes it possible for generator functions to produce a sequence of values over time, rather than producing the entire sequence of values all at once. This can be more efficient, especially when working with large sequences of data."

    "**5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Both map calls and list comprehensions are ways to apply a function to a sequence of elements and create a new sequence from the results. They are similar in that both can be used to perform an operation on each element in a sequence and create a new sequence from the results."
