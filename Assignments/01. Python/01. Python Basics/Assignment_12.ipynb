    "**1.In what modes should the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects will be opened?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The File object passed to `PyPDF2.PdfFileReader()` needs to be opened in **read-binary** mode by passing `'rb'` as the second argument to open(). Likewise, the File object passed to `PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()` needs to be opened in **write-binary** mode with `'wb'`."

    "**2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** You can get a Page object by calling the `getPage()` method on a PdfFileReader object and passing it the page number of the page you’re interested in. PyPDF2 uses a zero-based index for getting pages. The first page is page 0, the second is page 1 and so on. Hence in our case to get page object for page 5 we need to call **`getPage(4)`** "

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The pages of a PDF can be rotated in 90-degree increments with the **`rotateClockwise()`** and **`rotateCounterClockwise()`** methods. We need to pass one of the integers from 90,180 or 270 to these methods"
