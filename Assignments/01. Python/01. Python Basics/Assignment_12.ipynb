    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The File object passed to `PyPDF2.PdfFileReader()` needs to be opened in **read-binary** mode by passing `'rb'` as the second argument to open(). Likewise, the File object passed to `PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()` needs to be opened in **write-binary** mode with `'wb'`."

    "**2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** You can get a Page object by calling the `getPage()` method on a PdfFileReader object and passing it the page number of the page you’re interested in. PyPDF2 uses a zero-based index for getting pages. The first page is page 0, the second is page 1 and so on. Hence in our case to get page object for page 5 we need to call **`getPage(4)`** "

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In .docx files at the highest level, a `Document` object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of **`Paragraph`** objects for the paragraphs in the document and each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more **`Run`** objects.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** If you care only about the text, not the styling information, in the Word document, you can use the **`getText()`** function. It accepts a filename of a .docx file and returns a single string value of its text.The function opens the Word document, loops over all the Paragraph objects in the paragraphs list, and then appends their text to the list in fullText. After the loop, the strings in fullText are joined together with newline characters."
