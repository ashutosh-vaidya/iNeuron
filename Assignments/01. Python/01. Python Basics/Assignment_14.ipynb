    "**1.What does RGBA stand for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** An RGBA value is a group of numbers that specify the amount of red, green, blue, and alpha (or transparency) in a color. Each of these component values is an integer from 0 (none at all) to 255 (the maximum)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Pillow offers the `ImageColor.getcolor()` function so you don’t have to memorize RGBA values for the colors you want to use. This function takes a color name string as its first argument, and the string `'RGBA'` as its second argument, and it returns an RGBA tuple.\n",

    "**3.What is a box tuple, and how does it work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Box tuple is a collection of four integer coordinates that represent a rectangular region in an image. Below are the four coordinates:\n",
    "- `Left` The x-coordinate of the leftmost edge of the box.\n",
    "- `Top` The y-coordinate of the top edge of the box.\n",
    "- `Right` The x-coordinate of one pixel to the right of the rightmost edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the left integer.\n",
    "- `Bottom` The y-coordinate of one pixel lower than the bottom edge of the box. This integer must be greater than the top integer\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**7.What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**8.Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?**\n"
