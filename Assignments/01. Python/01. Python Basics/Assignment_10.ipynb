    "**1.How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** While `shutil.copy()` will copy a single file, `shutil.copytree()` will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.What function is used to rename files??**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** `os.rename()` can be used to rename files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The `send2trash` functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, while `shutil` functions will permanently delete files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Zipfile method equivalant to open is `zipfile.ZipFile()`\n",

    "**5.Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.**"
