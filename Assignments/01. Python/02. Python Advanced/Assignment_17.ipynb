    "**ans:** Greedy versus non-greedy syntax makes a difference when a regular expression pattern has multiple possible matches in a string. In such cases, the greedy syntax matches the longest possible substring that satisfies the pattern, while the non-greedy syntax matches the shortest possible substring that satisfies the pattern.\n",

In some cases, it may be necessary to use additional regular expressions or other methods to extract the desired substring."
