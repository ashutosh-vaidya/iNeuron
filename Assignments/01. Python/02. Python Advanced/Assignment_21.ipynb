    "**Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A probabilty distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in random events. It specifies the probability of all possible outcome of an experiment or observation such as possible values of a random variable or the possible states of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows us to predict the likelyhoodof an event or outcome of an event for example outcome of a coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** True random numbers are generated from an unpredictable source such as rolling of dice, flipping of a coin, or other physical processes. This are truly random and have an equal probability of occurring and cannot be predicted or reproduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "While, pseudo-random numners are generated by alorithms that use mathematical formulas and seed value to produce a sequence of number which appears to be random. They are not truly random because they are generated by deterministic process and can be predicted and reproduced if the alorithms and seeds values are known. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, of the seed value is chosen randomly then they can be considered \"good enough\" because they are usually indistinuishable from true random numbers and much faster and efficient to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a \"normal\" probability distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The two main factors that influence the behavior of a normal probability distribution are the `mean` and the `standard deviation`.Togethar the mean and standard deviation determine the shape and location of the normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The mean, also known as the average, is the central point of the distribution and determines the location of the peak or center of the distribution. If the mean of a normal distribution is increased or decreased, the entire distribution will shift to the right or left, respectively.\n",
    "- The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the distribution. It determines how tightly clustered or spread out the data points are around the mean. A larger standard deviation means the data points are more spread out, while a smaller standard deviation means the data points are more tightly clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** One real-life example of a normal distribution is human height. In most populations, human height follows a roughly normal distribution with a bell-shaped curve. Most of the people in a specific population are of average height. The number of people taller and shorter than the average height people is almost equal, and a very small number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be highly variable and unpredictable. This is because in a small sample size, random fluctuations can have a significant impact on the distribution, causing it to deviate from the expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we flip a coin 10 times, we might observe a distribution where heads come up 6 times and tails come up 4 times. This outcome is not unusual in a small sample, but it is not an accurate reflection of the true probability of the coin, which should be 50/50 in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of trials increases, the probability distribution will become more tightly clustered around its expected values, and the distribution will become more normal or bell-shaped, as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem. This means that the behavior of the distribution becomes more predictable and reliable as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The `random.shuffle` function can be used to shuffle a mutable sequence object in place. Mutable sequence objects include lists, byte arrays, and other types of sequences that can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Math package's general categories of functions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmatic functions: `floor, ceil, trunc` etc\n",
    "2. Trignomatic functions: `sin, cos, tan` etc.\n",
    "3. Exponential and logarithmic functions: `exp, log, log10, sqrt` etc\n",
    "4. Statistical functions: `mean, median, mode` etc.\n",
    "5. Special functions: `factorial, combinations, permutaions` etc.\n",
    "6. Complex functions: `complex, rect, real` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Exponentiation and logarithms are inverse operations of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Python's math module supports three logarithmic functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `math.log(x[, base])`: returns the natural logarithm (base e) of a number x.\n",
    "2. `math.log10(x)`: returns the base-10 logarithm of a number x.\n",
    "3. math.log2(x): returns the base-2 logarithm of a number x."
