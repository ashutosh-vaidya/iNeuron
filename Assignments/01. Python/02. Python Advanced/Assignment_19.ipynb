    "**Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an instance is a specific object created from that class. The relationship between a class and its instances is one-to-many, meaning that a single class can have multiple instances created from it. Each instance created from a class is unique and independent from the other instances created from the same class, and can have its own values for the properties and methods defined in the class. In other words, a class defines the common behavior and properties that all of its instances share, while each instance can have its own specific values and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The data that is held only in an instance is called instance-specific data. It refers to the unique data or state of an object that is not shared among other instances of the same class. This data can be any type of variable or object that is specific to the instance and is not shared with other instances of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The knowledge stored in a class provides the structure and behavior of the objects that can be created from that class. It defines the common attributes and behaviors of the objects and provides a blueprint for creating objects with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A method is a type of function that is associated with an object or class, and operates on the data or attributes of that object or class. A regular function is a standalone function that can be called from anywhere in the program, and does not operate on any object or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a parent or base class, and then extend or modify them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "    # class defination\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # class definition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Python supports encapsulation through the use of underscores to indicate whether a variable or method should be considered private or not. Variables or methods that are intended to be private are typically named with a single leading underscore, such as `_variable` or `_method()`. This is a convention that indicates that the variable or method should not be accessed directly from outside the class. However, it is still possible to access and modify these variables or methods using the object name or class name, as there is no strict access control in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A class variable is a variable that is shared across all instances of a class, whereas an instance variable is unique to each instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class variable is defined within the class but outside of any methods, and can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. Changes made to the class variable will be reflected in all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance variable is defined within the class constructor or any instance method, and is unique to each instance of the class. Instance variables can be accessed using the instance name and a dot operator. Changes made to the instance variable will only affect that specific instance."

    "**Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The `self` parameter is used in a class's method definitions to refer to the instance of the class that the method is being called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every method in a class should have a self parameter as the first parameter, unless it is a static method or a class method. This is because methods in a class are typically designed to operate on the instance of the class, and the self parameter provides a way to access the instance variables and methods from within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that self is not a keyword in Python, but rather a naming convention that is commonly used to refer to the instance of a class within a method. Other names can be used instead of self, but using self is a widely-accepted convention that helps to make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What is the difference between the `_ _add_ _` and the `_ _radd_ _` methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The expression `a+b` is internally translated to the method call `a.__add__(b)`. But if a and b are of different types, it is possible that a's implementation of addition cannot deal with objects of b's type (or maybe a does not have a `__add__` method, at all). So, if `a.__add__(b)` fails, Python tries `b.__radd__(a)` instead, to see if b's implementation can deal with objects of a's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A reflection method, also known as an \"inspection\" method, is a method that returns information about an object, such as its type, attributes, or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, reflection methods include `type()`, `dir()`, and `getattr()`, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to use a reflection method when you need to dynamically inspect an object at runtime, without knowing its exact type or structure in advance. For example, you might use reflection to determine the type of an object returned from a third-party library or to inspect the methods and attributes of an object created by user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you might not need to use a reflection method if you already know the type and structure of the object in question, or if you can use other methods to accomplish the same task more efficiently. For example, you might not need to use reflection to access an attribute of an object if you already know the attribute name and can access it directly using dot notation `(object.attribute)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q11. What is the `_ _iadd_ _` method called?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The `__iadd__` method is called the **\"in-place addition\"** method in Python. It is used to implement the `\"+=\"` operator for mutable objects like lists, sets, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `\"+=\"` operator is used with a mutable object, Python will try to call the `__iadd__` method on that object. If the object does not have an `__iadd__` method, Python will fall back to using the `__add__` method instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q12. Is the `_ _init_ _` method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Yes, the `__init__` method is inherited by subclasses in Python. When you create a subclass that does not have its own `__init__` method, it will inherit the `__init__` method from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to customize the behavior of the `__init__` method within a subclass, you can override the method by defining a new `__init__` method in the subclass. Within the new `__init__` method, you can call the parent class's `__init__` method using the `super()` function to ensure that any necessary initialization steps from the parent class are also executed.\n",
