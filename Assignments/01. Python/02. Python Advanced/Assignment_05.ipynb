    "**Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** When using classes and objects in an object-oriented programming language, a special feature known as an inheritance allows the child/derived class to reuse the behaviors and properties of the parent/base class. Inheritance is called an **is a** relationship. This means that when you have a Derived class that inherits from a Base class, you created a relationship where Derived **is a specialized version** of Base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python support a derived class to be inherited from more than one base class which is called as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Delegation is a design pattern in which an object, called the delegate, is responsible for performing certain tasks on behalf of another object, called the delegator. This can be done by the delegator forwarding method calls and attributes access to delegate. So basically it can be used as an alternative to inheritance and useful when implementing.\n",

    "**Ans:** All class data in python is technically public. Any attribute or method of a class can be accessed by anyone, however, there are dew ways to restrict access. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a **single leading underscore (_)**  indicates that the attribute or method is not public. \n",

    "Python implements name mangling: any name starting with a double underscore will be automatically prepended by the name of the class when interpreted by Python, and that new name will be the actual internal name of the attribute or method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main use of these pseudo-private attributes is to prevent name clashes in child classes: you can't control what attributes or methods someone will introduce when inheriting from your class, and it's possible that someone will unknowingly introduce a name that already exists in your class, thus overriding the parent method or attribute! You can use double-leading underscores to protect important attributes and methods that should not be overridden."
