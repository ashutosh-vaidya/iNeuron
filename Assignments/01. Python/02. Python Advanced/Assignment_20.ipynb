    "**Ans:** `float` and `Decimal` classess are both used for representing decimal numbers in Python. `float` is generally faster and more efficient, but it has limited precision and is prone to rounding errors. `Decimal`, on the other hand, provides arbitrary precision and accurate results, but it uses more memory and may require more complex code. \n",
